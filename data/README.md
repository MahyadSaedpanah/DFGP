# Datasets

Our dataset processing mainly follows the methods of [GPM](https://github.com/sahagobinda/GPM) (for PMINIST, CIFAR100 and Five) and [TRGP](https://github.com/LYang-666/TRGP) (for MINIImageNet). Refer to these repositories for preprocessing datasets.

Alternatively, you can download the [processed dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LuSsjrQNyleIKWySNYQy5zLSoSBxqQkb?usp=drive_link) and place it in this directory.
